## Problem Statement
Before this data can be used properly, we must transform and reshape our dataset.

## Datasets used

The individual [datasets](https://github.com/iweld/osha_fatalities/tree/main/csv) for this case study where downloaded from the [OSHA Archives](https://www.osha.gov/fatalities/reports/archive).  I condensed, cleaned and structured the data to be able to insert it into a database (osha_fatalities_09-22_complete.csv).

This database has one table named 'fatalities'.
